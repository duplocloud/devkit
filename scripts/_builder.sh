# Sourced by scripts/build-extension.sh and scripts/build-all.sh — decides whether a build runs on the
# caller's machine or inside the builder container, and launches the container when it should.
#
# Why a container at all: the dev-kit's runtime is entirely containerized, but the build was not — it
# hard-required `jq dotnet npm zip curl unzip` on the developer's laptop (and `jq` isn't shipped by
# macOS, so it was an undeclared prerequisite that failed at line 15). A compose-capable container CLI
# is now the only prerequisite.
#
# Every container command here goes through $RUNTIME (see scripts/_runtime.sh, sourced below) rather
# than a literal `docker`, so the same build works under docker or podman.
#
# REQUIRES scripts/_target.sh, sourced FIRST: this file uses its `_envv` (to read .env for BUILDER_IMAGE /
# BUILDER_PULL / BUILDER_TAG / STUDIO_PORT) and its `_TARGET`. Both current callers do source it first;
# that is a requirement of sourcing this file, not an accident of their layout.

# BASH_SOURCE, not $0: $0 is whichever script sourced this one, and build-extension.sh may be invoked
# from any cwd. _runtime.sh is idempotent, so sourcing it here as well as in run.sh costs nothing.

  # `{{json .Server}}` and NOT `{{.Server.Version}}`: the server struct is not the same shape across

#
#  1. INTERPOLATION IGNORES THE SHELL ENVIRONMENT. It reads ${VAR} from the .env file only, so every value
#     builder_dispatch exports falls through to its `:-` default instead. With DUPLO_BASE, DUPLO_UID/GID
#     and BUILDER_IMAGE all exported, `finch compose config` still rendered `DUPLO_BASE: ""`,
#     `user: 1000:1000` and the default image. An empty DUPLO_BASE then resolves in _target.sh to
#     http://localhost:<STUDIO_PORT>, which inside the container is the CONTAINER — so the SDK fetch dies
#     on a URL that looks right; and uid 1000 writes the bundle as an id the caller may not own.
#  2. NO WAY TO SET THE IMAGE. `compose run` takes it from the compose file and has no --image flag, so
#     together with (1) a pinned BUILDER_TAG/BUILDER_IMAGE has no route through at all.
#  3. A TTY IS FORCED. It always allocates one, and every spelling of the opt-out (--tty=false, -t, -T,
#     --no-TTY) is rejected — so a caller whose stdout is not a console (CI, a script, an agent) dies on
#     "provided file is not a console" before the build starts.
#
