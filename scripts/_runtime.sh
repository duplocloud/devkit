# shellcheck shell=bash
# Sourced FIRST by run.sh, stop.sh, logs.sh and scripts/* — resolves the container CLI once, so every
# call site reads `$RUNTIME run` / `$RUNTIME compose` instead of hard-coding `docker`.
#
# Why a variable rather than a `docker` shim on PATH: a shim is per-machine, invisible in the repo, and
# silently changes what every other tool on the box does too. RUNTIME is per-checkout, lives in .env
# next to every other knob (BUILDER_TAG, DUPLO_TARGET…), and is visible in the one place a reader of
# these scripts already looks.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS A RUNTIME HERE
# Every value below is a *client CLI* that speaks Docker's command grammar — `run`, `pull`, `build`,
# `info`, `version`, `image inspect` — AND ships a `compose` subcommand, because this kit drives the
# whole stack through Compose. That is the entire contract; anything meeting it can be added to
# _RUNTIME_SUPPORTED — but check the dispatch split in scripts/_builder.sh first, because `compose run`
# is not usable on every CLI that meets the contract, and the fallback branch there assumes a
# finch-shaped CLI.
#
#   docker   the default, and what the kit was written against.
#   podman   daemonless; rootless by default. See the uid note on runtime_builder_ids below.
#
# finch is TEMPORARILY de-listed, pending validation — it is not auto-detected and RUNTIME=finch is
# rejected. This is a claim-reduction, not a removal: every finch code path is still here and still
# correct, including the compose-bypass dispatch in scripts/_builder.sh and its notes on the three
# ways finch's `compose` fails silently. Re-enable by putting `finch` back in the array below; nothing
# else needs touching. The reason for de-listing is the same one that removed nerdctl: the kit should
# not advertise a runtime nobody is currently exercising.
#
# nerdctl is deliberately NOT here, and is not coming back. finch is the supported way to drive
# containerd in this kit: it is nerdctl plus the VM and the defaults that make it work on macOS and
# Windows, which is where anyone here is running containerd in the first place. Bare nerdctl was listed
# once and never exercised, and it shares finch's compose limitations without finch's setup. A
# native-Linux containerd user can still pin RUNTIME to a CLI of their choice by adding it back here —
# see the note above about the builder's dispatch split.
#
# runc is deliberately NOT here, though it was asked for. It is a *low-level OCI runtime*: it executes
# an already-unpacked bundle (a rootfs plus config.json) given by path, and has no concept of an image,
# a registry, a network or a compose file — `runc run busybox:1.36` cannot work, because runc never
# resolves an image name. It is the layer the CLIs above call *underneath* (this machine's podman drives
# `crun`, runc's C rewrite, via `--runtime`). Choosing the low-level runtime is a different knob from
# choosing the client, so runtime_resolve rejects it with that explanation rather than emitting commands
# that would fail later with something unrecognisable.

# The order here is also the auto-detect precedence: docker first, so a machine that has always had
# Docker keeps behaving exactly as it did before this file existed.
#
# NOTE: precedence is by PRESENCE, not by liveness (see runtime_detect) — so an installed-but-stopped
# docker still wins over a running podman, and the build then fails rather than falling through. Pin
# RUNTIME in .env on a machine that has both. Installing Docker alongside an existing podman is the
# common way to land on the wrong one without noticing.

# ── podman machine sizing ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# and is NOT elastic the way Docker Desktop's is. That one ceiling is shared by the whole stack (six
# containers) AND by every extension build — and the Angular Native-Federation build is the hungriest
# thing the kit runs: esbuild bundling the federation artifacts is what hits the wall first.
#
# It fails badly enough to be worth pre-empting. The OOM kill surfaces as a bare `Killed`, then ~100
# lines of Go "fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!" out of esbuild, and finally
# `exit status 137` — which is the only part that means "out of memory", and it is the last line anyone
# reads. Spending a few milliseconds here to say it in one sentence is a good trade.
#
# The floor is a JUDGEMENT CALL, not a measurement. The two known data points are: a 2 GiB machine with
# the stack up reliably OOMs the frontend build, and 8 GiB completes it comfortably. Nothing between was
# measured. 6 GiB is set as the hard floor (~4 GiB left for a build once the stack is running) and 8 GiB
# is what the message recommends. Both are overridable in .env for anyone whose workload disagrees.

  emulator:  QEMU — no 'rosetta' handler in the machine's binfmt_misc

amd64 binaries will run under QEMU user-mode emulation, which cannot run the studio's .NET runtime:
it aborts during startup, the container still reports "Up", and the wait for /healthz below would
spin for about 4.5 minutes before failing with a misleading "Login failed" — so this stops here.

$fix

$after

Confirm it took:

    podman machine ssh 'ls /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/'     # want 'rosetta', not 'qemu-x86_64'
    podman machine inspect --format '{{.Rosetta}}'        # want true

Alternatively, avoid emulation: if your studio tag publishes an arm64 variant, set
STUDIO_PLATFORM=linux/arm64 in .env. Docker Desktop is another way out — it ships Rosetta itself.
